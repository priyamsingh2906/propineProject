This code is a command-line program that reads a CSV file containing crypto transactions and calculates the portfolio value for the investor. The program takes command-line options to determine what information to display:

If no options are given, the program returns the latest portfolio value per token in USD.
If the "-t" option is given with a token symbol, the program returns the latest portfolio value for that token in USD.
If the "-d" option is given with a date, the program returns the portfolio value per token in USD on that date.
If both the "-t" and "-d" options are given, the program returns the portfolio value of that token in USD on that date.
The program uses the Node.js built-in modules "fs" and "readline" to read the CSV file line by line and parse the transaction data. It also uses the "axios" library to make a request to the CryptoCompare API to get the latest exchange rates for each token. The program uses the "commander" library to handle command-line options.

The "getExchangeRate" function takes a token symbol as input and makes a request to the CryptoCompare API to get the latest exchange rate for that token in USD. It returns the exchange rate as a number.

The "getPortfolioValue" function takes two inputs: a token symbol and a date. It reads the CSV file line by line and calculates the portfolio balance for each token. If a date is provided, the function stops processing transactions after that date. If a token symbol is provided, the function calculates the portfolio value for that token by multiplying the portfolio balance by the latest exchange rate. If no token symbol is provided, the function calculates the portfolio value for all tokens and displays the result using the console.table method.

The main code uses the "program" object from the "commander" library to parse command-line options. If the "-d" option is given, the program calls the "getPortfolioValue" function with the token symbol and date as inputs. If the "-t" option is given, the program calls the "getPortfolioValue" function with the token symbol as input. If no options are given, the program calls the "getPortfolioValue" function with no inputs.
